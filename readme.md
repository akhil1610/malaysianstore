# Instalation Process

First of all lets intall ionic globally by runing this in the console:

`npm install -g @ionic/cli `

For reference go to:
[Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli)
After everything is installed, clone this repo into you machine.

After the repo is cloned, go to the project directory by doing:

`cd ionic-easyeat `
Once in the directory of the App please run:

`npm install `

This will install all of the dependencies needed to run the project in your local machine.
Finally run:
`ionic s `

This will run the project in`:8100` port in your computer...

If it gives error called (cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.)
then run this command in powershell
Step 1 "set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser"
Step 2 "Get-ExecutionPolicy"
Step 3 "Get-ExecutionPolicy -list "
Step 3 "ionic s"



Happy Coding and good Look!
